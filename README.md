# Web Interface for Running Python Scripts

This repository provides a web interface for running Python scripts via a PHP backend. It allows users to input prompts or commands through a web form, which are then executed by Python scripts. The results are displayed back on the web interface.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided as an example and should not be considered production-ready. It is important to thoroughly review and understand the code before deploying it in a production environment. The author of this project assumes no liability for any damages or issues that may arise from the use of this code.

## Security Considerations

- **Validation**: Ensure that proper validation and sanitization of user inputs is implemented to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or SQL injections.
- **Restricted File System Access**: Limit the file system access permissions of the PHP backend to minimize potential risks.
- **API Key Security**: Handle sensitive data, such as API keys, with care. Store them securely and avoid hardcoding them directly in the code. Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism.
- **Authorization**: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to the web interface and prevent unauthorized use.
- **Secure Deployment**: Follow best practices for secure deployment, including the use of HTTPS, strong server configurations, and regular updates of dependencies.

## Repository Structure

- `local_server.html`: This HTML file contains the web interface for running Python scripts on a local server. Please note that this interface may not be secure for public deployment.
- `public_server.php`: This PHP file contains the web interface for running Python scripts on a public server. Exercise caution when using this interface in a public environment and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place.
- `example.py`: This Python script is provided as an example. Replace it with your own Python script that implements the desired functionality.

## Usage

1. Set up a local or public server environment to host the web interface.
2. Ensure that PHP is properly configured on your server.
3. Place the `local_server.html` or `public_server.php` file in the appropriate server directory.
4. Customize the PHP file (`public_server.php`) to execute the desired Python script and process the user inputs.
5. Update the Python script (`example.py`) or replace it with your own script to handle the user inputs and generate the desired output.
6. Test the web interface by accessing it through a web browser.
7. Modify and secure the code as per your requirements before deploying it in a production environment.

Please note that this repository provides a basic foundation for running Python scripts through a web interface, and additional modifications and enhancements may be necessary to meet specific use cases or security requirements.
